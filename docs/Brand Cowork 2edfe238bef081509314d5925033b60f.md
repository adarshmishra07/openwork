## The Problem (In Simple Terms)

Imagine you run an online clothing store. Every day, you need to:

> Write product descriptions for 50 new itemsCreate social media posts that "sound like your brand"Check what your competitors are pricing similar items atUpdate your website banners for a saleReply to customer emails in your brand's voiceAnalyze which products are selling well
> 

**Today, you either:**

1. Do it all yourself (exhausting, slow)
2. Hire people (expensive, hard to train on "your voice")
3. Use ChatGPT (generic, doesn't know your brand, can't actually DO things)

## The Opportunity

**What if you had an AI assistant that:**

```
✅ Learned your brand voice after onboarding
✅ Could actually log into Shopify and make changes
✅ Remembered what worked last time
✅ Could research competitors by browsing their sites
✅ Generated images, documents, and content in YOUR style
✅ Asked permission before doing anything risky

```

**That's BrandWork.**

## Why Now?

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   Claude Computer Use  +  OpenWork Framework  =  BrandWork │
│   (AI that acts)          (Desktop app shell)    (Commerce) │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

```

Three things just became possible:

1. **Claude can use computers** — Click, type, browse, just like a human
2. **OpenWork exists** — An open-source desktop app for AI agents (we don't start from scratch)
3. **Shopify has APIs** — We can connect and take real actions on stores

**The gap:** Nobody has built this specifically for **e-commerce brands** with **brand memory**.

# 🔐 Permission System

## Why Permissions?

> The agent can take real actions. We need human approval for anything that could cause harm or cost money.
> 

## Risk Levels

| Level | Examples | Approval Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Low** | Read product data, browse websites | Auto-approve |
| **Medium** | Generate images, write drafts | Ask once, remember |
| **High** | Update products, change prices | Always ask |
| **Critical** | Delete products, bulk updates | Always ask + confirm |

## Permission Flow

# 🛒 Shopify Integration

## Connection Flow

```
1. User clicks "Connect Shopify"
           │
           ▼
2. OAuth popup opens
   (Shopify login page)
           │
           ▼
3. User approves permissions
           │
           ▼
4. Callback with auth code
           │
           ▼
5. Exchange for access token
           │
           ▼
6. Store token securely
           │
           ▼
7. Connection confirmed ✅

```

## Permissions We Request

| Scope | Why We Need It |
| --- | --- |
| `read_products` | View product data for context |
| `write_products` | Update titles, descriptions, prices |
| `read_orders` | Analytics and reporting |
| `read_analytics` | Store performance insights |
| `read_content` | Access blog, pages |
| `write_content` | Update content |

## API Wrapper

The Rust backend wraps Shopify's API:

```
rust
Download
Copy code
// Example: Get products
shopify.products.list(filters)

// Example: Update product
shopify.products.update(id, changes)  // Requires permission!

// Example: Get analytics
shopify.analytics.summary(date_range)
```

# ✍️ Content Tasks (For Tushar)

## System Prompt

Write the core system prompt that tells Claude how to behave as a brand assistant.

**Requirements:**

- Emphasize brand voice adherence
- Explain available Spaces
- Define permission boundaries
- Set commerce-specific personality

## Brand Voice Templates

Create 5+ templates users can choose from:

| Template | Description | Example Copy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Professional | Formal, authoritative | "Discover our curated collection..." |
| Friendly | Warm, conversational | "Hey there! You're gonna love..." |
| Playful | Fun, witty | "Warning: These deals are addictive..." |
| Luxury | Sophisticated, exclusive | "Introducing the epitome of..." |
| Minimal | Direct, understated | "Simple. Beautiful. Yours." |

## Space Descriptions

Write descriptions for each Space that explain:

- What it does
- When to use it
- Example outputs

## Example Prompts

Create a library of example prompts for training and demos:

```
"Write 5 product descriptions for my new summer collection"
"Research what our top 3 competitors are charging for similar products"
"Create lifestyle photos for our bestselling bag"
"Update all sale items to 20% off"
"What were our top sellers last month?"

```

# ❓ FAQs

**Q: Why fork OpenWork instead of building from scratch?**

> OpenWork already solved the hard problems: Tauri shell, agent lifecycle, file management. We can focus on commerce-specific features.
> 

**Q: Why a desktop app instead of web?**

> Privacy (data stays local), performance (no latency), and system access (can run CLI tools, access files).
> 

**Q: How does brand memory work?**

> SQLite database stores brand context (voice, style, rules). Every agent prompt includes this context. Agent can also write back learned patterns.
> 

**Q: What if the agent makes a mistake?**

> Permission system catches dangerous actions. All changes are logged. Users can undo via Shopify admin.
> 

**Q: Can this work with non-Shopify stores?**

> MVP is Shopify-only. Future: WooCommerce, BigCommerce, custom stores via API.
